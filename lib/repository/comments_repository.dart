          'Epic Spider Man film is a love letter to fans! In a more poignant film than the previous Spider-Man films, Spider-Man No Way Home is a love letter for fans. With fun, thrills and tons of incridible action, this film is one of the best MCU films ever made',

          'Spider Man No Way Home given us what fans really wanted for so long! We always wanted to see Tom Hollands Spider-Man to become a badass Spider-Man like we never seen him before in Spiderman Homecoming in Spiderman Far From Home! Spider Man No Way Home is MCUs The Biggest and The Best Spider Man Movie like we never seen before! ',
